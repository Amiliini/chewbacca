I tried coding with Github Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Created react app and removed boilerplate code. 
Asked ChatGPT to create a random facts array, and started developing a simple webapp that shows random facts from a static array.
Then proceeded to "code" with copilot, by prewriting commetns and seeing what the AI comes up with.
Had to refactor a bit, used ChatGPT to do the refactoring and debugging.
Created the styling by asking ChatGPT to create a css file and fine tuned it by asking it to modify the file as I saw fit.

Also wrote a blogpost and LinkedIn post with AI. (will use them as examples on my real blogpost)
