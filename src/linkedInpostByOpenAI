Title: Exploring the Power of AI Coding Tools: My Experience

In the ever-evolving world of coding, developers are always on the lookout for tools to enhance their productivity. I recently had the opportunity to dive into the world of AI-powered coding tools by utilizing Copilot and ChatGPT OpenAI. Here's a glimpse into my experience:

As a self-taught developer with 2 years of experience, I was curious to explore how Copilot could assist me in writing code more efficiently. With my company's support, I delved into this AI tool and was impressed by its seamless integration with Visual Studio Code (VSC).

My goal was to build a web app using React, and Copilot became my coding companion. It guided me through the process, providing suggestions and helping me refactor code along the way. Additionally, ChatGPT OpenAI's assistance added a collaborative touch to my coding journey.

One significant challenge I faced was creating a random facts feature for the web app. I reached out to ChatGPT, requesting an array of 50 weird facts about humans. Its prompt response helped me overcome the daunting task of generating "fake" data, ensuring my app had interesting content.

Throughout the process, I found myself pairing with AI, almost as if I were pair-coding with a person. The combined efforts of Copilot and ChatGPT made the journey enjoyable and eye-opening. The generated code was reliable, and I only needed to make minor adjustments to tailor it to my needs.

This experience left me even more curious about leveraging AI tools in my work. While I initially worried about it hindering my personal development as a developer, I discovered a new way to code more efficiently. I highly recommend exploring the possibilities of AI in your coding journey.
